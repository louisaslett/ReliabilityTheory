## Install

You can install the latest release directly from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ReliabilityTheory/index.html).

```r
install.packages("ReliabilityTheory")
```
-->

## Install development version

**NOTE:** the package is currently not on CRAN due to removal of a package we depend on.
I am currently working to get it back on CRAN, but in the mean time, please install directly from Github as follows:
<!-- Installing directly from [GitHub](https://github.com) is not supported by the `install.packages` command. -->

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("louisaslett/ReliabilityTheory")
```

Under releases, the tree/commit from which CRAN releases were made are recorded, so historic source can be downloaded from there.
